    FeelDX is a leading digital media and project planning firm with a strong presence in Australia and the Indo-Pacific region. We have evolved from a visual design studio to a full-service project planning group specialising in cutting-edge immersive visualisations, project planning and control solutions.

    When there is a complex build project, or a vision that is begging to be made a reality; where there is a need to improve existing systems, to build something entirely new, to better serve a local community, or to educate, FeelDX brings your project to life through its innovative project planning methodology and visual media technology.

    We continue to serve a wide range of industries and have established ourselves as the preferred project control team for the construction of data centres and complex development projects.
